Draft of marketplaces scraper

So this is an example of  asynchronous web scraper that allows to parse some data from different marketplaces:
Ozon.ru, wildberries.ru, aliexpress.com, market.yandex.ru
This is just a draft that needs to be tweaked and completed with some code
I've created it some month ago and used in one of my projects.
I know there are some issues, such as duplicated parts of code and others, 
but i'm lazy fatass))
Since this code is here in open repo, you can use any part of it in your projects, if upvoite me:)
